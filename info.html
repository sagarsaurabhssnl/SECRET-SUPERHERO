                <h2>Story</h2>
                This Game is devoted to those special workers who have got oppurtunity to be a superhero by cleaning the
                society from the monsters who claim to be human but aren't,
                they just looks like humans in our society but they are monsters who tries to kill our workers by
                several demoralising ways. The normal peoples are also with them as those peoples consider them to be
                of same kind.
                The problem is with our superhero(sanitation waorkers) at the most because the are initially minority
                and
                not gettiing support even from those for whom they works. So just give our superhero a helping hand by
                playing
                this gamme and let our socity live longer, cleaner and positive.<br>
