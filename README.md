# SECRET-SUPERHERO

=====>I will recommend this game to be played on a desktop sized output screen

Consider downloading the files then host it via your localhost(check below) to play the game despite of much patience(depending on your storage type).

#Localhost
=> You can use the live server extension in VScode to host it after opening the particular folder.
=> You can also use 200 OK server available in chrome web store through this link(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) and then just select the folder and host it. Easy Right...
